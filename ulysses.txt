As a consequence of Arizona’s first electrical storm in recorded history, the cardboard structure in which I was living (at the very reasonable price of $7 a week + utilities from an ornery coyote – of the people-smuggling trade, not the mongrel quadruped) – went up like a shoebox doused in ethanol. A shame, as my landlord was 3 payments shy from installing another wall. Fortunately, though, I had the good mind to escape the blaze through some gap in logic and flag down the neighborhood ice-cream cart man. Much to my consternation, the geriatric vendor took even longer than usual to retrieve my regular Flintstones push-up frozen treat, as he kept pointing with what I must say seemed considerable fervor and conviction for a blind man known for fighting lampposts when drunk, at a nearby building, the awning of which had served as roofing and dreamcatcher for my former abode and had evidently, at present, caught fire. The deranged old man flailed about, screaming such incongruous babble as, “There are people in there!”(an early indicator of Alzheimer’s, I’m afraid). I applied the cold, orange balm generously to my burns, extensive as they were. Finally I told him to keep the change and took up my post in the shallowest recesses of my cerebellum, keeping mind’s eye peeled for the serial cat burglar who had thus far ransacked the contents of my hypothalamus, in addition to the big thing on top of it and the other responsible for patience and the capacity to refrain singing Turandot in falsetto when it rains. Still, there remains one component in the matter that makes very little sense: the thief’s eccentric propensity for leaving a haiku at the scene of the robbery – his calling card, if you will – written in binary code. His interpretation of the form’s structure is unorthodox, let me assure you and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharans and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down Jo me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.
